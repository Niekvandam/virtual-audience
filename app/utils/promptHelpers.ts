        Evaluate these aspects on a 1-5 scale:
        - Clarity of message
        - Relevance to audience interests
        - Visual appeal
        - Usability of interface
        - Credibility of content
        - Innovation in approach
        - Target audience fit
        - CTA effectiveness
    
        Provide 1-10 concise feedback points in newlines and an overall score between 1 and 10. 
        The overall score should reflect the quality of the marketing materials in relation to the target audience. 
        Additionally, the overall score cannot contrast the aspects' scores. If you rate mostly 4s and 5s, the overall score should be between 8 and 10 (out of 10).
        Keep in mind that the audience's preferences and characteristics should guide your evaluation.
